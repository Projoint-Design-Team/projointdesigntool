# Tutorial

This guide will walk you through how to create a discrete choice experiment using this tool in conjunction with Qualtrics. We will go through four steps: attributes, settings, restrictions, and exporting to Qualtrics.

## Attributes

## Settings

For details on each of these settings, please see the [Settings page](01_settings.md).



## Restrictions

There are two types of restrictions we discuss: cross-attribute restrictions and cross-profile restrictions. Cross-attribute restrictions prevent a profile from being logically inconsistent. For example, in a conjoint study comparing potential immigrants, if an immigrant has only a middle school education, their career cannot be neurosurgeon. Cross-profile restrictions produce dependencies across the different profiles of one task. For example, in a conjoint study comparing political candidates in a two-party, if one candidate is polling at 60%, the other must be polling at 40% or less.
